# Stock-Price-Dataset-using-Matplotlib
**Objective**
<br>To be Proficient in finding correaltions, using pandas and matplotlib for creation of Plots.
<br>
<br>***Problem Definition***
<br>**Q.1)** *Download any one stock price according to your roll number (for eg, Roll No 10 - BRITANNIA.csv, as Britannia <br>is the 10th stock in the list).
<br>
<br>**Q.2)** Import the dataset onto python as a Pandas DataFrame, as df.
<br>
<br>**Q.2)** Take any one year's data from the datasets, and name it as stockprice_one_year. Use this newly created <br>DataFrame for the future analysis.
<br>
<br>**Q.3)** Compare stockprice_one_year['feature_name'].plot() vs df['feature_name'].plot()
<br>
<br>**Q.4)** Check whether matplotlib's plotting is better in looks. Once the plotting is done, check what is the impact in <br>Plots,if you execute the line of code: plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
<br>
<br>**Q.5)** Find the correlation between the features. Make a Correlation Heatmap. Write your observations about the same.
<br>
<br>**Q.6)** How can you plot multiple features in a single plot? For instance, use a red line for "LOW", green line for <br>"HIGH", and black line for "CLOSE".
<br>
<br>**Q.7)** What does plt.fill_between() do? can you shade the region between LOW and HIGH?
<br>
<br>**Q.8)** Take the CLOSE price, can you give a colour for the first half of the year, and a different colour for second half?
<br>
<br>**Q.9)** Does BoxPlot signify something for the sampled dataset?*
<br>
<br>**Approach/ Methods**
<br>Importing Pandas for creation of Dataframe, using seaborn for Plots like heatmap
<br>
<br>**Observations**
<br>*Used Pandas for making the dataframe
<br>Used seaborn for creating Heatmap and plots
<br>Using Inbuilt Display function to display the dataframes
<br>Used Inbuilt function and condtions to extract data
<br>Used matplotlib for creating different plots like line chart,etc
<br>Converted date into datetime format*
<br>
<br>**Results**
<br>
<br>*• Better Analysis of Datasets 
<br>• Data Representation
<br>• Less Writing of Code
<br>• Efficiently handling huge data
<br>• Considered as one of the useful library for analyzing data
<br>• Using Matplotlib for Better creation of plots
<br>• Finding Correllation between Data*
<br>
<br>**Learning & Reflection**
<br>Better understanding of different types of correlation in Python
<br>Got Through with Matplotlib, seaborn and creating plots
